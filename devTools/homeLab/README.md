# HomeLab // Home Server

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to have hosting/cloud services at a fraction of the cost and in a testing format to not lose billions of dollars by accidentally using AWS's to infinitely compute a recursive function I incorrectly implemented.

### Goals

Be able to host web projects/apps and/or remotely access tools saved on my own server. Limited shared access. 

### Hardware

Orange Pi 5 Plus SBC will be used to host storage space and perform processing.

### Services/Software 

Using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdHvS0D1zAI) as a starting point.

*Do a further search on homeLab cloud services etc...*

**Exploration**
1. Orange Pi 5+ OS's 
   1. Considering having multiple Linux images
   2. Considering a windows image
      1. Can always emulate 
2. Figure out how to host multiple domain names
   1. However a primary Domain (my name related/professional) can have subdomains/directories that aren't linked on outward facing professional presentations
3. Configure separate OS's to work with same IP address/IP service
4. Consider RAID/NAS 
5. Remote Linux Server secure access
6. Pi-Hole


## Special Considerations

Static IP Address: eventually possibly contact ISP
